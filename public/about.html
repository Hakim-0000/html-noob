<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! Let me introduce myself, my name is Luqman Hakim. I'm a lifetime learner, aspiring Web Developer and Cybersecurity Enthusiast.</p>

<p>My hobby is learning something new everyday. Like this website, i learn how to make a website recently by watching and following a tutorial from Dr. Angela Yu in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG3@5Htc1F3yCcaj3TQv8KlFTah8oVnzMcSvXHbipInNnsRtNDFHu6wk0_uZj_wDsnEoaA==/">Udemy</a>. The course is really fun with all the quis, challenges, memes and humor from her. I also doing at least one Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge everyday to escalate my cybersecurity knowledge. I played CTF mostly in <a href="https://tryhackme.com">Tryhackme</a> and because of playing CTF everyday, now I'm in <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/urk3e">top 1% in Tryhackme</a>.</p>
